This was a simple database-like application coded in C++ modeled after something like a simple bank account holder record system. It reads in records stored in a specified format from a text file, allows the user to read, write and modify existing records and addition of new records or deletion of existing records. When the program is exited it writes the changes into the text file storing the data.

There is a 1.0 version written in C, which was rewritten in C++ as needed and expanded on to create this version.

Both projects were compiled and tested on a Unix server accessed through a SSH client and using the SCCS version control system. Most of the coding was done in the Eclipse IDE on Windows with Cygwin .
