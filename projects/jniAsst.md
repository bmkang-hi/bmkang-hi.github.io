summary: Coursework demonstrating ability to research and implement new techniques without direct instruction
---

The application itself is a simple temperature converter that takes a user input max temperature value in Celsius > 0 then displays all temperatures in Fahrenheit from 0 C to the given temperature rounded to the next multiple of 5, in multiples of 5.
Main purpose

The application uses the Java Native Interface (JNI) to make calls from a Java frontend that handles all user interfacing functions, to C functions that do the calculations.

This assignment had minimal direct instruction and was focused on the ability to do research and write code using techniques and libraries we had not yet been exposed to, independently
